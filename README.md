2. Game summary:
Overview:
- Farm must be a phrase, a strange thing for those who have lived in cities since childhood because we are surrounded by skyscrapers close together, amusement parks with many modern games. The aim to provide a variety of experiences to "city kids" motivates us to develop a farming RPG game called “Sprout Lands”, in which the player can incarnate as a farmer and take care of crops on their land. 
- Gameplay style: Stardew Valley
- Camera: Top down 
- Players: Single player 
- Scope (hours): 30 minutes 
- Target audience: The game is aimed at players who want to play idle games for relaxation, players who love the farming genre. 
- Target release date: 8th July 2022 
- Lead development platform: Windows

Key ideas:
- Explore the life of a farmer : The crops of the tropics are always lush and play an important role in the lives of the people of this land. Incarnate as a farmer and explore your farm and enjoy the perfect farm life! 
- Build a real farm: Explore the empty lands. Cultivate and harvest crops, picking juicy fruits. In this land game, your success in farmer life depends on your farming skills. 
- You own a farm that will become bigger, giving you the opportunity to develop a big farm from scratch.

3. How to play:
The player use “w, a, s, d” or ↑ ← ↓ → from the keyboard to move. They can run by pressing shift & control keys.

At first, each player is provided with 3 tools, 5 types of seeds (10 seeds / each type) and a complete map to explore.

Each day, the character only has a certain amount of energy for reclaiming and farming activities.

Reclaim
- The character can cut down forest trees to have arable land, harvest wood and do stone mining. Note that you must choose the right tool for each object by selecting on the toolbar to interact with it (as described in game feature)
- Collect items by going through it.
- These items will be stored in the inventory.

Cultivation
- The character uses the correct tool to make a hoe on arable land.
- He/she chooses the type of seed he wants to plant in the Storage.
- He/she sows seeds and waters plants regularly to grow plants.
- After the plant is ready to harvest, harvest it. These items will be stored in the inventory.
